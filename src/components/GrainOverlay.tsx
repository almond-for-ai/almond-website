/**
 * Site-wide paper grain.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the registry's canvas-based noise component: that one
 * measures itself once on mount with no ResizeObserver, so if layout isn't
 * settled it writes a 0px canvas and never recovers — and animating it
 * regenerates per-pixel noise in JS every frame for a texture nobody
 * consciously sees. An SVG feTurbulence tile is static, resolution
 * independent, costs no JS, and reads the same.
 *
 * Server component: no client boundary needed.
